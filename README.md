# Search_Engine
Developing a mini search-engine in python using reverse-indexed stemming and other SEOs implementations
Start the program by running python3 launcher.py
A flask webpage will start.
If you do not have any indexes files, the webpage will show you an error
There is a button at the top of the page called Run Indexer
THIS IS EXTREMELY TIME CONSUMING AND DANGEROUS. IT WILL DELETE THE INDEX IF YOU ALREADY HAVE ONE !
So to safeguard this, you have to click the button five times in a row in five different refreshes of the page

You can also create the index by running python3 indexer.py

After the indices are created you can go ahead and search through them
