### Things done for improvement
 1. Create index of index for substantial gain in efficiency and speed.
 2.  Split TF-IDF into TF and IDF for more specific calculations when needed without the whole computation. This also removes the relevance on external library for TF-IDF.
 3. Switched from using IDF & weight, to TF & weight for helping with the overall weight.
 4. Dropped indexing and searching of unigram, bigram, and trigrams.
 5. Add length of document during indexing for improved speed via normalization calculation.
